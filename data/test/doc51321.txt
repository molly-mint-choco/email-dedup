Hi Sandra,

Thanks for your note on the upcoming all-hands meeting. I agree that it's an excellent opportunity to discuss our company culture and take a pulse check on how we're doing. I would suggest that we incorporate an open forum for everyone to express their thoughts and maybe even share some experiences. 

Let's chat more about this during our 1:1 tomorrow. I'm looking forward to exchanging more ideas on how we can make our culture even better. 

Best,

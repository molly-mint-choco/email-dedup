Dear Tyler,

In follow-up to our previous conversation, I have been reflecting on the sales forecast and the pipeline of prospective projects. It seems that the landscape of our market is continuously changing, which naturally impacts our predictions and potential deals.

I am of the opinion that we should reconvene to reassess our strategies, taking into consideration these new developments. We could also use this meeting to discuss how these changes could affect our visual designs and the communication strategies related to them.

Please share your thoughts and let's aim to schedule this meeting at the earliest possible convenience.

Regards,
Kiara Dou

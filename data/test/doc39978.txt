Hi Sandra,

I hope this email finds you well. Following up on our previous conversation, I've spent some time thinking about the points you raised regarding our daily operations.

Your insights were very valuable and I agree that there's room for improvement. I'll be scheduling a meeting next week to discuss potential changes. I think your perspective would be incredibly useful in this discussion, so I'll make sure to include you.

Looking forward to your continued input.

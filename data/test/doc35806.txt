Hi Samantha,

Just touching base on the adjustments we discussed during our last team meeting. I see some solid progress and it's great to see the team adapting well to the new operational procedures. A big shout-out to you and Daniel for the effective execution of these changes.

Let's keep up the good pace and remember to keep an eye on those key performance indicators. We'll review the impact of these changes in our meeting next week. 

Best,
Neil Thompson

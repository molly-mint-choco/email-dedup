Hi Garrett,

I hope this email finds you well. I've been thinking about our last conversation on market engagement and have some additional thoughts.

While our traditional approach has served us well, I feel that we might benefit from diversifying our strategies. Broadening our perspectives may help us connect with different segments of our audience in a more meaningful way.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. If you're open to it, maybe we can schedule a brainstorming session with Alexis and the team next week?

Looking forward to your feedback.

Best,
Louise Chen

----------------------------------------

Hi Garrett,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to touch base with you regarding some recent shifts in our operations strategy that you might have noticed.

In our continuous pursuit of efficiency and excellence, we've initiated few changes in our operational procedures. While these changes are designed to streamline our processes and improve productivity, we understand that any change can bring about a period of adjustment.

To help you navigate through these changes, we've prepared a comprehensive guide that should provide clarity and direction. This guide outlines the new procedures, the rationale behind them, and the impact they will have on your day-to-day responsibilities. I'll be sending it your way shortly.

In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. Your input is valuable to us, and we want to ensure that this transition is as smooth as possible for everyone involved.

I'll be scheduling a team meeting next week to discuss these changes in depth. I hope to see you there.

Thanks for your understanding and cooperation as we work towards creating a more effective working environment.

Best,
Louise Chen
CMO

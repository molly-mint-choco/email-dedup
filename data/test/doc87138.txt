Hi Linda,

I trust this finds you well. Just following up on our discussion concerning the Q2 revenue projections. I've been combing through our sales data and I must say, it's looking promising. We're tracking above forecast for this quarter and our pipeline is robust.

I'll be finalizing the report by end of the day and will share it as planned. Feel free to reach out if you have any specific areas you'd like me to focus on.

Best,
Wayne Johnson

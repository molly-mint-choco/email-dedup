Hi Rachel,

Thank you for your email and suggestion. 

I absolutely agree with the idea of gathering insights directly from the team members. This will not only give everyone a chance to have their voices heard but will also provide diverse perspectives, potentially guiding us towards enhancing our company culture.

I will put together a plan to facilitate these discussions and gather thoughts in the most engaging and productive way. Let's explore this further during the all-hands meeting. 

Thank you for your continued guidance.

Best,
Thomas

Hi Thomas,

Thanks for your insights in the previous email. I agree that a focus on our company culture is key to improving overall team dynamics. As we approach the all-hands meeting, it might be useful to gather thoughts from different team members on what they believe defines our culture and areas where we can improve.

If you could facilitate this, we could have some valuable talking points for our meeting and a clearer direction on how to enhance our company culture.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

Best,
Rachel Brooks

Dear Neil,

I trust this message finds you well. I wanted to touch base regarding our discussion on our company's marketing strategy, specifically on the topic of brand visibility. 

As we continue to grow and expand into new markets, it is certainly crucial that we increase our brand visibility. This will not only help us to gain a larger customer base but also strengthen our position within the industry. I agree wholeheartedly with your suggestion of utilizing various digital platforms to achieve this, especially given the current digital age. The possibilities are endless, from social media advertising to content marketing and SEO optimization.

However, I believe we should also consider exploring traditional methods of marketing, such as print and broadcast media. These channels still hold significant value and can reach a different demographic that might be overlooked by digital marketing. By integrating both digital and traditional marketing strategies, we can assure a holistic approach to our brand visibility.

I propose we arrange a meeting with the marketing team next week to delve into this further. We can discuss potential avenues for each method and how best to implement them. Please let me know what date and time would work best for you.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this.

Best regards,
Alexis Lowe

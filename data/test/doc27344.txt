----------------------------------------

Dear Samantha, 

As we approach the final stages of our current project, I wanted to touch base and ensure that we're all on the same page. I trust everything is proceeding as planned and that we're all set for our imminent completion date. 

If there are any issues or concerns that you feel need addressing, please don't hesitate to let me know. Daniel, feel free to add anything that you believe is important for us to consider at this point.

Looking forward to our successful project completion.

Regards,
Neil Thompson

Hi Linda,

I'm glad to hear you find the suggestion beneficial. Regarding the feedback, most points revolve around improving user-interface and enhancing customer support response rate. There are also minor concerns about our recent pricing model and some suggestions on diversifying our offerings.

There's a lot to unpack and discuss and I think our conversation will be highly productive. We would consider each feedback point in detail during the meeting and plan forward for improved strategies.

Thanks for your willingness to delve into this matter. I appreciate your proactive approach.

Best,

Wayne

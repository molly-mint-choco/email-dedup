----------------------------------------

Hi Linda,

I hope this email finds you well.

Following up on our recent meetings, I thought it would be beneficial to forward you the details of our newly proposed compliance protocols. These have been drafted keeping in mind the nuances of the current legal landscape.

The aim is to ensure that our business practices align with the legal requirements and also to cultivate a culture of compliance within our organization. With your expertise in operations and Kevin's understanding of our corporate structure, I believe we can create a solid compliance framework that will serve us well into the future.

Please take a look at the attached document which outlines these protocols in detail. I would appreciate your input on the feasibility from an operational perspective. Perhaps we can arrange a meeting next week to discuss this further? Kevin, I'd value your thoughts as well.

Looking forward to a collaborative effort on this important topic.

Best,
Wayne Johnson

Dear Sandra,

I trust this email finds you well. I've been reflecting on our previous conversation concerning our current marketing strategies and wanted to share a few thoughts.

While our current tactics have shown some promising results, I believe there's room for enhancement and growth. We might want to consider incorporating a more data-driven approach into our strategy. This could include, for example, analyzing our customer behavior data more closely to inform our decisions.

I'd be very interested in discussing this further with you and Dennis. Could we perhaps schedule a meeting for next week to delve into this? I'm confident that by pooling our expertise, we can refine our tactics and achieve our marketing objectives more efficiently.

I look forward to your thoughts on this matter.

Best regards,

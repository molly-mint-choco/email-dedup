Dear Rosalie,

I hope this email finds you well.

Following our previous conversation regarding our sales trajectory, I have revisited the data and have some fresh insights to share.

Our pipeline seems robust, with several promising leads in the pipeline that may convert soon. It's too early to count them as wins, but I am optimistic about the potential they bring.

However, as is always the case with sales forecasts, there's a measure of uncertainty involved. I encourage you to take these projections as a rough guide rather than hard fact.

I look forward to our discussion on this topic during our meeting next week. In the meantime, if you have any questions or need further clarification, please feel free to reach out.

Best regards,

Ivan Mitchell

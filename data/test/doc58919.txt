Hey Tyler,

Just wanted to share some interesting points that have popped up from the most recent client discussions. It seems like there are some recurring themes in what our customers are saying about our services.

I think it would be worthwhile for us to sit down and discuss these points. I believe it could offer some valuable insights into how we can improve our services and overall customer experience. What do you think?

Let me know when you have some time to chat about this.

Best,
Kiara Dou

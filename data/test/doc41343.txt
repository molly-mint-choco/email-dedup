Subject:  Fine-Tuning our Fiscal Strategy

----------------------------------------

Hi Neil, 

I trust this email finds you well. I've been thinking about our upcoming fiscal year and the planning that we have in the pipeline. I believe it would be beneficial for us to have a quick catch-up meeting to ensure our budgetary goals are aligned and our financial roadmap is as efficient as possible for the upcoming quarter.

I'm free next Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon if either of those times work for you. Samantha, I've included you in this email as well because your insights have always been valuable to us.

Let's make this a productive year for BigCorp!

Best,
Alexis Lowe

Dear Garrett,

I trust this email finds you well.

I wanted to bring your attention to some recent developments in our talent acquisition strategy. Over the past few months, we've been working hard to fine-tune our approach, focusing on attracting top-tier talent to support our strategic objectives.

As a part of this process, we've rolled out an enhanced competency framework and adopted a more focused approach to sourcing. We have also been investing in our employer branding to make our company an employer of choice across the industry.

I believe it's crucial that we align our people strategy with our business objectives. As such, I'm eager to involve you and Alexis in this initiative. Your insights into the current market trends and client expectations will be invaluable as we refine our talent acquisition strategy.

I propose we schedule a meeting next week to discuss this in more detail. Alexis, I have copied you in on this email as I believe your input is also vital to this discussion.

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best,
Louise Chen

----------------------------------------

Dear Adam,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to you regarding the recent review of our company's compliance procedures. Our intention is to ensure that our business operations are fully in line with legal standards and regulations, thus minimizing potential risks and liabilities. 

As you know, being compliant with all the laws and regulations that pertain to our business is not just a legal requirement, but an integral part of our corporate values. By maintaining a strong compliance program, we are not only reducing the risk of non-compliance, but also strengthening our company's reputation and integrity.

Recently, we have conducted an internal audit to assess our current compliance procedures. Our audit has identified several areas of improvement and in light of this, we are planning to implement a series of changes to our compliance program. This includes, but is not limited to, updating our company policies, enhancing our training programs, and strengthening our internal controls.

However, before we proceed with these changes, we believe it is crucial to get your input as one of our key stakeholders. Your expertise and perspective will be invaluable in ensuring that our updated compliance program is comprehensive, effective, and aligns with our business objectives.

We appreciate if you could review the attached document, which provides a detailed summary of our current compliance procedures and the proposed changes. We would be grateful if you could provide your feedback and suggestions by the end of next week.

Once we have gathered all the feedback, we will schedule a meeting to discuss the final plan for the implementation of our updated compliance program. We will ensure to communicate any changes in a timely manner to all employees to ensure a smooth transition.

Thank you for your attention to this important matter. Your commitment to maintaining the highest standards of compliance and integrity is greatly appreciated. 

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need any further clarification.

Fiona White

Dear Eileen,

I hope this message finds you well too.

I'm glad to inform you that the ongoing technical infrastructure modernization project is on track. We have successfully completed 70% of the tasks and are working diligently on the remaining 30%. 

At this point, we do not anticipate any major issues that could potentially delay the project. However, we are closely monitoring a couple of minor concerns related to our software integration process. We are confident of resolving these promptly and within the given timeline.

Should anything change, we will be sure to keep you updated.

Thank you for your continued support.

Best Regards,
Ruby

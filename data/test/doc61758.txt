Hi Harper,

Thank you for sharing this information. I'm indeed interested to hear more about these insights from the recent customer interactions. I can definitely see the potential benefits for our ongoing project.

I'm available all week in the afternoons. Let me know what time works best for you, and we can schedule a meeting then.

Look forward to our discussion.

Best, 
Sam

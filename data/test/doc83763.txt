Hi Harriet,

I hope this message finds you˙ well. You bring up a ve∘ry important concern that I agree merits prompt attention. The reassessment and upgrade of our technical infrastructure is⌀ certainly crucial to ensuring our efficiency and adaptability in the face of evolving technolo•gies. 

I commend your idea t⁀o conduct a ‸comprehensive audit of our current infrastructure·. This evaluation will be pivo∗tal 
in identifying areas that need improvement. The possibility of involving an external consu′ltant in drafting a st′rategic action∙ plan is equally no∗teworthy and we can consider this as we proceed.

Garrett's expertise would unquestionably be valuable, and I'm confident that a collective effort can yield the best outcome.

I would love  to si
t down and discuss the way forward. Early next week, W·ednesday or Thursday, preferably afternoo∙n, would work well with my schedule.

I appreciate your commitmen⎼t to keeping our infrastr∙ucture up-to-date∗ and I look forward to our productive discussions.

Best,
Louise

Hi Louise,

Hope this email finds you well. I trust you're navigating through our current projects smoothly. I thought it's about time we sat down to discuss a matter I believe we should address sooner rather than later - the robustness of our technical infrastructure.

Over the past few years, we've seen a significant increase in our company's data usage and the need for more reliable, efficient systems. Our current tech setup has been serving us well, but as we continue to expand and incorporate more complex technologies into our operations, I'm beginning to envision a potential strain on our existing infrastructure. 

We're in a dynamic industry, and the future is moving towards AI, machine learning, and other advanced technologies. Hence, it's crucial for us to anticipate these changes and ensure that our technical infrastructure is not only capable of handling our current needs but is also scalable and adaptable for future growth.

I propose we begin by conducting a comprehensive audit of our current infrastructure. This will help us identify any gaps or inefficiencies that need to be addressed. Following that, we can engage with our IT department or even consider bringing in an external consultant to help us plan a roadmap for upgrading our systems.

I've CC'ed Garrett on this email. His experience and insights would be beneficial as we move forward with this. 

Let's set up a meeting next week to discuss this further. I'm open to suggestions on the date and time. 

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this.

Best,
Harriet Song

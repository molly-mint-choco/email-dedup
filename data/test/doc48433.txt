Hi Carter,

I hope this email finds you well. I was just looking over your input from our last discussion on the upcoming all-hands meeting, and I must say, I found it very insightful. 

Your suggestion about linking the meeting with an open discussion on the company culture is something I think we should definitely consider. It's a great opportunity for everyone to understand more about what drives us as a team and could really help to foster a stronger sense of unity and purpose.

Now, the logistics of integrating this into the meeting agenda will require some thought. We need to ensure that it doesn't detract from the core objectives of the gathering, while still providing a meaningful and engaging experience for all attendees. I think this could be an excellent opportunity to bring in some guest speakers or organize some interactive workshops. What are your thoughts on this?

Felicia, you've always had a knack for this kind of thing. Any ideas on how we could make this work?

Let's keep this conversation going and see if we can turn this idea into a reality. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

Best,
Natalia Ponce

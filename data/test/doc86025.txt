Hi Glen,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out to share some thoughts and updates regarding our sales forecast and pipeline.

As you've probably noticed, our team has been putting in a lot of effort lately to maintain a healthy, robust pipeline. We've managed to secure some promising leads and our sales forecast is looking optimistic. However, there are a few potential roadblocks that we need to navigate around.

While our current projections are encouraging, I think it would be prudent for us to review the data together. We can discuss our strategy moving forward and perhaps brainstorm a few innovative approaches to ensure we continue on this positive trajectory.

Morgan, I've copied you in on this as your input would be greatly appreciated too. With your extensive experience and insight, I believe we can work together to further enhance our sales strategy.

I suggest we arrange a meeting soon to discuss this in more detail. How does your schedule look for the coming week?

Looking forward to your replies.

Best,
Tasha Burke

Dear Thomas,

I hope this email finds you well. 

Following our conversation during yesterday's meeting on the topic of brand outreach, I’ve been reflecting on the points you have raised. I agree with your view that we need to modify our current approach to better resonate with our target audience.

I believe our marketing strategy should pivot towards a more customer-centric model. By focusing on their needs and delivering value, we can enhance our brand image and foster a stronger relationship with our customers. This, in turn, will not only increase our customer retention but also attract new prospects.

To that end, I propose a meeting where we can discuss this in detail and brainstorm innovative ways to implement this new approach. We can involve Bella in our discussions as well to get her valuable insights. 

Please let me know a suitable time for you next week. I am flexible and can adjust to your availability. 

Looking forward to our continued discussions on enhancing our marketing strategy.

Regards,
Rachel Brooks

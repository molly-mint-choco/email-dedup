Hi Rosalie,

I hope this email finds you well. I've been going over the details for the upcoming product launch and I think we're in a good position. I wanted to touch base and ensure we're on the same page before we proceed.

Could you please confirm if there are any outstanding tasks we need to address? I want to make sure we have all our bases covered. Nikhil, your input here would be invaluable as well. 

Looking forward to hearing from you both.

Best,
Ivan Mitchell

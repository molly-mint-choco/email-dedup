Hi Jordan,

Thank you for your email. I appreciate the recognition of the marketing team's efforts.

I understand the importance of reviewing the financial aspects in these final stages. I have been monitoring the costs and revenue forecasts closely and I'm currently consolidating this data. I assure you, we are still on track with our initial projections.

I will send over a detailed update first thing tomorrow morning, which will include any significant changes, if any. This way, we can engage in insightful discussions well before the end of the week. 

Thanks for keeping a keen eye on these details as we approach the product launch.

Best regards,

Deena

Hi Deena,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to follow up on our previous discussion regarding the upcoming product release.

I understand that the marketing team has completed their part of the project, and I would like to commend them for their efforts thus far. However, I wanted to touch base on the financial aspects before we proceed. As we are in the final stages, I believe it would be beneficial to have a quick review of the projected costs and revenue forecasts to ensure we're still on track.

Could you please provide an update on the current numbers? Additionally, if there have been any significant changes in the budget or revenue expectations, it would be great to discuss them before the launch.

Let's aim to finalize everything by the end of this week so we can ensure a smooth and successful product launch.

Thanks in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.

Best,
Jordan Gray

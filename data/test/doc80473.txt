Dear Ruby,

Following our recent discussion on the financial outlook for the next quarter, I have taken the liberty of reviewing the proposed budget and anticipated expenses. 

While there are a few areas that may require some adjustments, overall the plan seems to be in alignment with our financial guidelines and objectives. I would suggest we schedule a meeting next week to discuss in detail and make any necessary amendments.

Thank you for your diligent work on this. Please let me know a suitable date and time for the meeting.

Best regards,
Eileen Carter

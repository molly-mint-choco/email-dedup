Hi Wayne,

Thank you for bringing this to my attention. I appreciate your initiative and agree that discussing it in our team meeting could be beneficial. 

In the meantime, could you perhaps share a brief overview of the feedback received? This would help me prepare ahead of the meeting and be in a better position to contribute to the discussion effectively.

Thanks once again for your invaluable insight. 

Best,

Linda

Hi Linda,

Just a quick note to share some interesting feedback we've received from our latest client interactions. It seems there are some areas we could improve upon. I believe it's worth discussing in our team meeting this week.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best,
Wayne Johnson

Hi Louise,

Hope this email finds you well. I wanted to touch base with you regarding our sales projections for the next quarter and our current pipeline status. 

As we're heading into the final stretch of this quarter, it would be great if we could get some insights into what the next few months might look like. I understand it's not an exact science, but having an idea of what we're working toward can really help us align our efforts and inform our strategies.

Also, I'm curious about our current pipeline - how are things shaping up? Are we seeing good movement or are there any areas we need to focus on a bit more? It's always good to have a pulse on these things, and I know you've got your finger on that pulse.

When you have a moment, let's set up a meeting to talk through these topics. I think it would be beneficial for both of us, and Garrett as well, to have a clear view of the road ahead. 

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Best,
Harriet Song

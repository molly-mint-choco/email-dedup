Dear Thomas,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to bring to your attention some updates we're implementing in our internal policies. While these changes primarily revolve around operational efficiency, they also touch upon certain legal aspects that I believe fall within your purview.

I'd greatly appreciate it if we could arrange a meeting at your earliest convenience to discuss these matters. Bella, your inputs would be valuable as well. 

Looking forward to your positive response.

Best,
Rachel Brooks

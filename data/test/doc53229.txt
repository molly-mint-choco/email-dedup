Hi Thomas,

Thanks for your insights in the previous email. I agree that a focus on our company culture is key to improving overall team dynamics. As we approach the all-hands meeting, it might be useful to gather thoughts from different team members on what they believe defines our culture and areas where we can improve.

If you could facilitate this, we could have some valuable talking points for our meeting and a clearer direction on how to enhance our company culture.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

Best,
Rachel Brooks

Hi Martin,

Hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out today to discuss the impending product launch. With the release date just around the corner, it's essential that we're all on the same page and have our ducks in a row.

Our team has been working tirelessly on this project, and I'm confident that our efforts will pay off. That being said, it's vital that we don't drop the ball at this critical juncture.

I'd like to schedule a meeting for early next week to go over our launch strategy and ensure that any last-minute details have been ironed out. I believe Annabel has some key insights about the market that she'd like to share as well.

Please let me know when would be a good time for you. Looking forward to our discussion.

Best,
Colleen Jenkins

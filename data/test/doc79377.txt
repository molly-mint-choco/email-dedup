Hi Deena,

Following up on our previous conversation, I've completed a preliminary analysis of the projected costs for our upcoming IT infrastructure upgrades. It's looking like we're going to be slightly over our initial budget due to some additional server costs. 

Would you be available for a quick call tomorrow to discuss? I'd like to get your input on how best to adjust our financial planning to accommodate this.

Best,

Hi Sam,

Hope you're doing well. In response to your earlier note, I've reviewed our recent compliance audit findings and have a few concerns regarding the legal implications mentioned in section 4. I believe we need to delve deeper into this to avoid any potential issues.

Let's schedule a meeting with Michael and discuss this further. Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,

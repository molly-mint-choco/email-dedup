Hi Glen,

Hope you're doing well.

I've been reviewing the recent feedback we've received from our customers, and there are some insightful points that I believe could help us improve our products and services. I think it would be a good idea to discuss these in our next team meeting.

Let me know if you're available for a chat sometime this week to go over the main points before the meeting.

Best,
Tasha Burke

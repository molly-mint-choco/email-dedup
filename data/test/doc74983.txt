Hi Sabrina,

Hope this message finds you well. I wanted to touch base regarding our current compliance and legal policies. I believe it's time for us to review them to ensure that we are up-to-date with all recent regulations. 

Could you please arrange a meeting with the legal team next week? Let's discuss the potential areas that may need revision and plan accordingly. 

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this matter.

Best,
Morgan Redwood

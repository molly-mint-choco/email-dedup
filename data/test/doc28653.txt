Dear Carter,

I trust this message finds you well. 

I'm writing to bring your attention to some exciting developments here at BigCorp. We are on the cusp of launching a new product that promises to revolutionize our current market offerings. As part of the team involved in this process, I felt it necessary to keep you updated on the progress and the timeline we have for this endeavor. 

Our Research & Development team has been working tirelessly over the past months to create a product that not only meets our customers' needs but exceeds their expectations. We are confident that this new product reflects our commitment to innovation and customer satisfaction, and we are eager to see it bring significant value to our users.

In anticipation of this launch, we have been coordinating with the Marketing team to prepare a comprehensive go-to-market strategy. This includes a series of promotional activities, both online and offline, to ensure a successful product introduction. We are also working on a detailed product manual, aimed at providing our customers with all the necessary information to maximize their experience with the new product.

We are planning to officially launch the product in the next quarter. Until then, we will be conducting a series of internal tests and analyses to ensure the product is ready for market and meets our rigorous quality standards. As a valuable member of our team, we encourage you to provide any feedback or insights that you believe would be beneficial in this process.

I understand that this is a significant undertaking and I want to assure you that we are doing everything in our power to ensure a successful product launch. Your support and input during this process will be invaluable. 

I will keep you updated on our progress and I am looking forward to hearing any thoughts you may have on this matter.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

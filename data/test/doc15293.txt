Dear Thomas,

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to touch base on the progress of our Talent Management Initiative.

I am pleased to report that the early feedback from the team is encouraging. However, I believe there is still room for improvement and your insights could be valuable.

Could we set up a time this week to discuss this further? Your perspective as a seasoned professional would be greatly appreciated.

Best,
Rachel Brooks

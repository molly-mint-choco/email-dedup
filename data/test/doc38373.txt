Hi Linda,

I hope this email finds you well. Kevin and I have been discussing the recent modifications in our operations. We thought it would be beneficial to share our insights with you, considering your critical role in the overall process.

It's been observed that the new workflows are showing positive trends in our productivity. We believe that with further fine-tuning and your expert input, we can optimize them for even better results.

Let's catch up sometime later this week to discuss this more in detail? 

Best,
Wayne Johnson

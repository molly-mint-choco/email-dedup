Hi Natalia,

Thank you for your email and your offer to clarify a few of the points in the new compliance policies.

A follow-up call sounds great. My Thursday is flexible, so let's aim for 2 p.m. If there is a more convenient time for you, please let me know and I'll do my best to accommodate it.

Looking forward to our discussion.

Best,
Carter

Hi Carter,

Just wanted to quickly touch base regarding the new compliance policies we discussed in yesterday's meeting. I believe there were a few points you wanted further clarification on.

Let's set up a follow-up call sometime this week to ensure we're all on the same page. How does your Thursday look?

Best,
Natalia Ponce

Hi Martin and Annabel,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to share some observations I've noted from recent interactions with our clientele. There seems to be a pattern in their responses to our latest product launch, which could be worth our attention.

I've consolidated these insights into a brief report, which I'll be presenting at our team meeting next week. It would be beneficial to discuss these findings as a group and strategize accordingly.

Looking forward to our productive discussion.

Best,
Colleen Jenkins

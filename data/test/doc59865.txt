Hi Deena,

Just wanted to touch base on the customer feedback we discussed in our last meeting. I've been thinking about the insights we gathered, particularly regarding our new product line.

It seems our customers are appreciating the innovative features we've added. However, a few have pointed out room for improvement in our customer service response times. 

Maybe we can schedule a brainstorming session with the team next week to discuss this? Let me know what you think.

Best,

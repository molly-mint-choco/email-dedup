----------------------------------------

Hi Mario,

I hope this email finds you well. I was just running through some of the ideas we discussed in our last brainstorming session. The one about redefining our promotional approach really stuck with me. 

It's pretty clear that we need to take a fresh look at our marketing strategy. We've seen some solid results from our current approach, but I believe there's always room for improvement, don't you? I've been thinking about how we could be more innovative in the way we reach out to our audience. 

Perhaps we could push the envelope a bit and try something more audacious? I've been toying around with the idea of a brand collaboration or a social media influencer campaign. These are just some of the thoughts off the top of my head, but I'd love to hear what you think.

Also, I'd like to loop Bianca into this conversation. She's got a great eye for trends and I believe her input would be invaluable as we try to steer our marketing ship in a new direction.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this, Mario. Let's arrange a time next week to discuss this in more detail.

Best,
Grace Harper

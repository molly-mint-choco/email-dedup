----------------------------------------

Hi Mario,

Hope this email finds you well. I wanted to forward this message to you and Bianca as it pertains to our ongoing conversation about the company's culture and the upcoming all-hands meeting. This was initially discussed in the departmental meeting, and I believe it's critical for us to align our understanding and expectations.

Our collective journey as a team here at BigCorp has been both challenging and rewarding, shaping our company culture in the process. Over the years, we've seen how our shared experiences, values, and commitment to our mission have fostered a culture of innovation, collaboration, and respect.

In the coming weeks, we'll be hosting an all-hands meeting to reflect on our journey and discuss the future direction of our company culture. This meeting is an opportunity for every team member to voice their thoughts, ideas, and concerns. It's a platform to celebrate our achievements, learn from our challenges, and chart our path forward.

In preparation for the all-hands meeting, I encourage you both to reflect on your own experiences at BigCorp. Think about what our company culture means to you, what you value about it, and where you see room for improvement. Your insights will be invaluable in shaping our discussion and ultimately, the future of our company culture.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

Best,
Grace Harper

Dear Carter,

Following our recent discussion on next quarter's financial outlook, I've gone ahead and initiated a thorough analysis of our current budget. I believe this will help us gain a clearer perspective of our financial standing and prepare for the upcoming quarter effectively.

I will be sharing the preliminary findings with you and Felicia shortly. Let's plan to reconvene next week to discuss in more detail.

Regards,
Natalia Ponce

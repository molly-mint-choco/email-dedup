Dear Samuel,

Following our recent conversation regarding Talent Management, I believe we need to focus more on refining our HR strategies. This will ensure we are making the most effective use of our talent resources and meet our objectives.

As discussed, adopting new approaches to employee engagement, performance management and talent development could help us retain the best talents and attract new ones. It would be beneficial to consider these factors in our upcoming meeting.

I believe that by incorporating these changes, we can foster a more productive and satisfied workforce, which ultimately reflects in our overall performance.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,

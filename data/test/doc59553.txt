Dear Deena,

I'm glad to hear you found the feedback useful. I agree, a brainstorming session would indeed be beneficial in addressing the concerns about our customer service response times.

Tuesday afternoon works perfectly for me. Let's move forward and schedule this to enrich our customer experience.

I appreciate your initiative and look forward to working closely with you and the rest of the team on this.

Best regards,
Jordan

Hi Deena,

Just wanted to touch base on the customer feedback we discussed in our last meeting. I've been thinking about the insights we gathered, particularly regarding our new product line.

It seems our customers are appreciating the innovative features we've added. However, a few have pointed out room for improvement in our customer service response times. 

Maybe we can schedule a brainstorming session with the team next week to discuss this? Let me know what you think.

Best,
Jordan Gray

Hi Harriet,

Thank you for your email. I completely agree that having a solid understanding of our upcoming quarter and current pipeline status will benefit all of us.

I am already compiling the latest data on our sales projections for the next quarter and I will prepare an overview of our current pipeline for our discussion. I share your wish to ensure we are optimally aligned and focused, and I welcome the opportunity to delve into these subjects more deeply.

Would the upcoming Wednesday at 10 AM work for you for our meeting? Garrett is also available at this time. We can utilize this opportunity to address your queries and discuss our strategies ahead. 

Looking forward to your confirmation and the shared insights in our meeting.

Best Regards,
Louise

Hi Louise,

Hope this email finds you well. I wanted to touch base with you regarding our sales projections for the next quarter and our current pipeline status. 

As we're heading into the final stretch of this quarter, it would be great if we could get some insights into what the next few months might look like. I understand it's not an exact science, but having an idea of what we're working toward can really help us align our efforts and inform our strategies.

Also, I'm curious about our current pipeline - how are things shaping up? Are we seeing good movement or are there any areas we need to focus on a bit more? It's always good to have a pulse on these things, and I know you've got your finger on that pulse.

When you have a moment, let's set up a meeting to talk through these topics. I think it would be beneficial for both of us, and Garrett as well, to have a clear view of the road ahead. 

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Best,
Harriet Song

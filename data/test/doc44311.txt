Hi Martin,

I trust you're doing well. Following up on our last meeting, I wanted to see how the newly implemented changes to our operations are faring. Are we seeing any significant improvements in efficiency? 

I think it's crucial for us to assess the impact of these changes accurately to ensure we're moving in the right direction. If there are any grey areas that need clarifying, or if you have any suggestions, please do not hesitate to share.

Looking forward to your insights.

Best regards,
Colleen Jenkins

Dear Garrett,

I trust this email finds you well. I am forwarding this communication to you in light of our ongoing discussions regarding the imminent product launch. We are on the verge of taking a significant step forward in our strategic roadmap, and your involvement is crucial to its success.

Over the past few months, we have made significant strides in the development and testing of our new product. The feedback received from our beta testers has been overwhelmingly positive, and our market research indicates a strong demand for this offering. This is an exciting time for our company, and we are eager to share this excitement with our loyal customers and the broader market.

However, before we proceed with the public unveiling, I would like to request your team's assistance in finalizing a few critical aspects. 

Firstly, we need to ensure that our marketing materials accurately represent the product's unique features and benefits. Your team's insight and understanding of our target audience's needs will be essential in this task. We need to ensure that our messaging resonates with our audience and builds anticipation for the product.

Secondly, we need to fine-tune our product positioning. While we have a general understanding of where our product fits in the market, your team's expertise and understanding of the competitive landscape will be invaluable in helping us effectively position our product.

Lastly, we need to firm up our product launch timeline. We aim to launch the product by the end of the quarter, but we need to ensure that we have ample time for final testing, adjustments, and promotional activities.

I am confident that with your team's assistance we can achieve a successful product launch. I would appreciate it if we could set up a meeting early next week to further discuss these matters. Please let me know a time that works best for you and your team.

Thank you once again for your commitment and hard work towards this important initiative. I look forward to our continued collaboration.

Best,
Louise Chen

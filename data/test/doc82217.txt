Subject: Enhancements to Our Tech Infrastructure 

----------------------------------------

Dear Rosalie,

I trust this email finds you well. I am writing to discuss an important topic that has been on our agenda recently - enhancing our technical infrastructure.

As you know, our company has been growing exponentially, and with this growth, the need to upgrade our technical infrastructure is becoming increasingly apparent. Our systems, while reliable so far, need to be fortified to sustain this growth and ensure seamless operations in the future.

With this in mind, I'd like to propose a meeting with you, Nikhil, and myself to discuss our options moving forward. Nikhil has a robust understanding of our technical needs, and your experience in guiding our operational strategies will be invaluable in making the right decisions.

I suggest we meet next week to begin discussing potential upgrades, strategies, and budget allocations. Please let me know a date and time that would work best for you. 

I believe that by collaborating on this important issue, we can ensure that our technical infrastructure continues to support our company's growth and success effectively.

Thank you for your time, and looking forward to your thoughts on this matter.

Best,
Ivan Mitchell
Director, HR

----------------------------------------

Dear Louise,

I hope this email finds you well.

I wanted to discuss a matter that has recently come to our attention. Several of our clients have reached out with their thoughts on our products and services. Their comments vary, reflecting both their satisfaction with our offerings and areas where they believe we could improve.

In light of these comments, it would be beneficial for us to review these client impressions and evaluate their potential impacts on our business. I propose a meeting next week to discuss this in detail. I believe that by addressing these comments proactively, we can leverage this feedback to enhance our performance and continue to meet our clients' expectations.

Please let me know a suitable time for you, and I will arrange the logistics accordingly. I look forward to your response and to our productive discussion.

Best regards,
Harriet Song

Subject: Clarification on New Compliance Policies 

----------------------------------------

Hi Carter,

Just wanted to quickly touch base regarding the new compliance policies we discussed in yesterday's meeting. I believe there were a few points you wanted further clarification on.

Let's set up a follow-up call sometime this week to ensure we're all on the same page. How does your Thursday look?

Best,
Natalia Ponce

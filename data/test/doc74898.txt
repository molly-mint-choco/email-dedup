Hi Morgan,

I hope this email finds you well. I completely agree with your suggestion of conducting a thorough revision of our current compliance and legal policies.

I will arrange a meeting with the legal team next week as suggested. Once the meeting date and time are confirmed, I will send out an invite to all parties involved.

Thank you for bringing this to my attention. I’m confident that working together we can ensure all our policies remain up-to-date and compliant with all recent regulations.

Kind regards,

Sabrina

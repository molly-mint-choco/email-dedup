Hi Thomas, 

I trust this finds you well. I came across some interesting comments from our clients that I thought might be of interest to you and Bella. It seems there's a wealth of insight we can glean from these interactions to better serve our customers.

Would you have some time this week to discuss this? I think it would be beneficial for us to review this together.

Best,
Rachel Brooks

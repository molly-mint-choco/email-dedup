Dear Louise,

I trust this email finds you well. I am reaching out in regard to our recent discussions on talent management and the need to enhance our acquisition strategies.

I concur with your perspective that in order to attract a high caliber of talent, we need to rethink and optimize our current strategies. Your suggestion of investing more in our employer branding and leveraging social media platforms is indeed insightful. It aligns well with the current trend of how top-performing companies are attracting talent.

Additionally, I believe that we should also focus on improving our talent retention strategies. This could be achieved by creating a more conducive work environment and fostering a strong culture of learning and development within our organization. Moreover, offering competitive benefits and emphasizing work-life balance could also play a crucial role in retaining our top talent.

I suggest we arrange a meeting with Garrett, and other key stakeholders involved, to further discuss these points and formulate a detailed plan. Please let me know your availability for the same.

Thank you for your dedication to improving our HR and talent management processes. Your efforts are truly appreciated.

Regards,
Harriet Song

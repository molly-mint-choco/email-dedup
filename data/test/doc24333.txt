Subject: Fwd: Revisiting our Approach to Brand Promotion

----------------------------------------

Hi Sam,

Trust you're doing well. I've been doing some thinking and I believe it's about time we revisited our current marketing strategy. Following our last conversation, I've been exploring some new angles that might help us target our audience more effectively.

Based on our recent performance metrics, it seems that our current approach is not resonating as much as we'd hoped with our target demographic. I believe a fresh perspective could help us to better align our branding efforts with our audience's interests and needs.

I've attached a rough draft of a new marketing proposal that I've been working on. It's centered around a more user-focused approach, aiming to foster a deeper connection with our audience through interactive content and personalized experiences. I'd love to get your thoughts on this.

Let's also rope in Mike on this. Mike, I'd appreciate any insights or suggestions you might have. Let's aim to have a round-table discussion sometime next week to further flesh out this strategy.

Looking forward to your feedback and the exciting journey ahead.

Best,
Harper Dean

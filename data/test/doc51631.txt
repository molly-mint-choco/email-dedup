Hi Louise,

Absolutely, our conversation about the financial forecasts for the next quarter is fresh in my mind. I am working on it and will have a detailed review ready for you ahead of the budget planning meeting. 

I will ensure you have it in your hands by the end of this week for your perusal.

Best Regards,
Garrett

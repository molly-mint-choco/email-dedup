Hi Deena,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to follow up on our previous discussion regarding the upcoming product release.

I understand that the marketing team has completed their part of the project, and I would like to commend them for their efforts thus far. However, I wanted to touch base on the financial aspects before we proceed. As we are in the final stages, I believe it would be beneficial to have a quick review of the projected costs and revenue forecasts to ensure we're still on track.

Could you please provide an update on the current numbers? Additionally, if there have been any significant changes in the budget or revenue expectations, it would be great to discuss them before the launch.

Let's aim to finalize everything by the end of this week so we can ensure a smooth and successful product launch.

Thanks in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.

Best,
Jordan Gray

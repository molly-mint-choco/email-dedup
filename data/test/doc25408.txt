Dear Colleen,

Thank you for your email and the heads-up on the upcoming meeting. 

I agree that it would be beneficial to revisit our promotional tactics, especially considering the recent digital advancements made by our competitors. Your idea to diversify our strategies and put more emphasis on digital engagement is very timely.

Annabel and I will certainly utilize the time before the meeting to brainstorm ideas and investigate up-and-coming strategies that would put us ahead in the digital space. Your forward-thinking approach is greatly appreciated and we are eager to contribute our insights that will hopefully fortify BigCorp's competitive edge.

Should any questions or preliminary ideas arise, I'll be sure to get in touch. Looking forward to our productive discussion next week.

Best regards,

----------------------------------------

Dear Martin,

I trust this email finds you well. I am reaching out to you concerning our promotional tactics, which as you may recall from our last departmental meeting, is a key component of our overarching marketing strategy. I believe it's time we revisit and reassess this particular area of our strategy in light of prevailing market trends.

It's been brought to my attention that our competitors have been making significant strides in their marketing efforts, particularly in the digital space. They are leveraging emerging technologies and platforms to better target and engage with their audience. This is something we need to address urgently to ensure we remain competitive.

In order to effectively counter these advancements, I propose a meeting to discuss our current promotional tactics and to explore potential areas of improvement. I'd like us to consider incorporating more digital engagement strategies into our marketing mix. This might include revamping our social media strategy, exploring influencer marketing, or even investing in some form of AR or VR marketing.

I believe that by diversifying our promotional tactics, we can better cater to changing consumer behaviors and preferences. It's crucial that we remain adaptable and responsive to the market if we're to continue driving growth and success for BigCorp.

I encourage you and Annabel to brainstorm ideas ahead of the meeting. I'm particularly interested in hearing any innovative or out-of-the-box strategies you may have come across. Your expertise in this area will be invaluable as we navigate these changes.

I will be scheduling a meeting for next week to delve into this further. I look forward to an engaging and productive discussion. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or would like to discuss any preliminary ideas.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best,
Colleen Jenkins

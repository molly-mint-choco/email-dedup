----------------------------------------

Dear Samuel,

I trust this email finds you well. I am forwarding an important conversation thread which I believe will be of significant interest to you. 

In our last All-Hands meeting, we discussed the vital role that our company culture plays in our everyday operations and our long-term success. We all agreed that cultivating a strong, positive, and collaborative company culture is a top priority for us as we move forward. 

It is with this in mind that we are planning our next All-Hands meeting. The focus of this meeting will be to further explore and strengthen our community within Bigcorp. We believe that by doing this, we can ensure that our company culture is not just a concept, but a living, breathing entity that positively impacts our work and our relationships with each other.

As part of the agenda, we will be exploring opportunities for team-building activities, cross-departmental collaborations, and open discussions on how we can improve our internal communication and mutual support. We also encourage everyone to share their ideas and perspectives for building a more inclusive and engaging work environment.

Your insight and involvement in this initiative would be invaluable. We hope that you will join us in the upcoming All-Hands meeting and contribute to shaping our company culture.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions in the meantime.

Best regards,
Harper Dean

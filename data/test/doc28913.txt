Dear Linda,

I trust this email finds you well. I'm writing in response to our most recent discussion regarding our forthcoming product introduction into the market.

Our team has been diligently working on aligning all the necessary resources and defining the strategies that will ensure a successful launch. As you are aware, the product's success hinges significantly on our ability to communicate its unique value proposition to our target audience effectively. In line with this, I'd like to explore the possibility of collaborating with the marketing department on this initiative.

Given the marketing team's expertise in crafting compelling narratives and their in-depth knowledge of market trends, I believe their involvement will greatly enhance our product positioning and overall launch strategy. I'd appreciate it if you could facilitate a meeting with the relevant parties from the marketing department at your earliest convenience. 

Additionally, I'd like to propose a review of the product's key features and benefits, which we can incorporate into the marketing collateral. This will ensure we are all on the same page and conveying a consistent message to our customers.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this matter. Please feel free to reach out should you require any additional information.

Best regards,
Wayne Johnson

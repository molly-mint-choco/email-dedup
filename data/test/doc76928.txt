Dear Carter,

I hope this message finds you well. Following our recent discussion on the ongoing Infrastructure Modernization Project, I wanted to provide you with an update on our progress.

Our technical team has been working tirelessly to ensure the smooth transition from our old systems to the new ones. As of now, we have completed approximately 75% of the planned upgrades, and we anticipate the remaining work to be completed within the next two weeks. This includes the overhaul of our server infrastructure and the implementation of new security measures designed to protect our data and systems.

In addition, we have also started the necessary preparations for the testing phase. This will allow us to identify any potential issues before the new infrastructure goes live. I would like to schedule a meeting with you and Felicia next week to discuss the testing protocols in more detail and to ensure that our teams are aligned in this critical phase.

Rest assured, we are committed to ensuring that this transition causes minimal disruption to our operations and that any potential issues are addressed promptly. We understand the importance of a robust and reliable technical infrastructure in supporting our business operations, and we are dedicated to making this project a success.

I look forward to hearing from you regarding a suitable time for the meeting. In the meantime, please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns.

Regards,
Natalia Ponce

Subject: Emphasizing Our Identity: Upcoming All-Hands Meeting

----------------------------------------

Hi Adam,

I trust this email finds you well.

I wanted to touch base with you regarding our upcoming All-Hands meeting. We have a unique opportunity to emphasize and celebrate our company culture during this gathering. I believe your insight and leadership would be instrumental in shaping our discussions and helping us foster a more collaborative and open environment.

Would you be open to a brief chat next week to discuss your thoughts and how we might best incorporate this into the agenda?

Looking forward to our chat soon.

Best,
Fiona White

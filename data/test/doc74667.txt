Dear Louise,

I trust this email finds you well. 

Following up on our previous discussion, I have taken into consideration your feedback regarding the recent changes to our compliance procedures. Your point on ensuring adherence to legal standards while maintaining efficiency in our operations is well-noted.

Over the next week, I am working with the team to implement the suggestions you provided. We will ensure that these amendments align with both our internal policies and external legal requirements.

If there are any further insights you wish to share or any concerns you may have, please feel free to contact me. Your input is greatly appreciated in this matter.

Best regards,
Harriet Song

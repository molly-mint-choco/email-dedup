Dear Jameson,

I trust this email finds you well. I am forwarding you an earlier correspondence that I have had with the Legal Department in the hope that it might be of interest to you, considering your indispensable role in our organization. 

As you are aware, our industry is becoming increasingly regulated and it is crucial that we adhere strictly to these regulatory guidelines to maintain our good standing and avoid any potential legal complications. In light of this, I have been in discussion with our Legal Department to ensure that our operations and business processes are aligned with the applicable regulations.

The forwarded correspondence, which also CCs Harriet Song from the Legal Department, includes a comprehensive outline of the regulatory guidelines that we must adhere to. Additionally, it provides a detailed plan for an internal audit that will ensure we remain compliant. 

While I understand that this might add to your already full plate, I believe that it is critical to stay informed about these issues, as they directly impact our work and the overall direction of our company. 

I propose we convene a meeting with Harriet and the rest of the leadership team to discuss the contents of the forwarded correspondence. This would provide us with an opportunity to clarify any ambiguities, answer any questions that might arise, and determine our next steps. 

Please take some time to review the forwarded email and its attachments, and let me know if you have any immediate questions or concerns. Once you have done so, I would appreciate it if you could suggest a suitable date and time for the proposed meeting. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to our continued cooperation in ensuring BigCorp's compliance with all relevant regulatory guidelines.

Regards,
Sabrina Patel

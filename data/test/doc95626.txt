Dear Sabrina,

I trust this message finds you well.

In light of our recent discussions, I believe it is crucial to revisit our financial plans for the upcoming quarter. As we approach the last quarter of the fiscal year, it is essential that we ensure our budget aligns with our strategic objectives.

Let's consider our current operational costs and revenue streams, and evaluate if there are any areas we can streamline to increase efficiency. Furthermore, I would like to explore potential opportunities for growth, which may require adjustments to our budget.

I invite your thoughts on this, and would appreciate if you could work closely with Jameson to prepare a revised financial plan. Your expertise and insights are invaluable in this process.

Thank you for your continued dedication to BigCorp's success.

Best regards,
Morgan Redwood

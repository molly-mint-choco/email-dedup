Hi Carter,

I hope this email finds you well. 

I've been looking over our current prospects and I'm optimistic about the potential for growth this quarter. Our pipeline seems strong and there are some substantial opportunities we should capitalize on. 

I've attached the updated sales forecast for your review. It would be great if we could touch base sometime next week to discuss strategies for moving these opportunities forward. 

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best,
Natalia Ponce

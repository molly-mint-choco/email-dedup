Hi Janice,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to touch base following our recent All-Hands Meeting. It was indeed a productive session and I appreciate everyone's input on the various topics we discussed. 

I believe that one of the pivotal points raised during our discussion was the evolution of our company culture. I gathered that there's a shared enthusiasm about the strides we've made in this area. However, there's a consensus that we still need to continue to build a more inclusive, dynamic, and rewarding environment. 

As a follow up, I suggest we arrange a meeting with Victor and the rest of the team to further discuss and explore the initiatives we're planning on integrating into our company culture. We'll need to flesh out the details of the implementation process, assign responsibilities, and set realistic timelines. 

I'm confident that with our collective efforts, we can shape our work environment into one that not only aligns with our brand but also empowers each member of our BigCorp family. 

Let's keep the conversation going. Please share your thoughts and availability for the proposed meeting. 

Best,
Daniel Morales

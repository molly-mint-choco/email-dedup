Hi Deena,

Just thought I'd forward you the latest on our contractual obligations. Seems like there's a bit of legalese that needs our attention. 

Ron, I've copied you in as well - your input would be greatly appreciated. 

Let's catch up soon to discuss next steps. Thanks in advance for your time.

Best,

Hi Sabrina,

Following our discussion on the status of our current technical infrastructure, I've had some thoughts. How about we schedule a brief meeting with Jameson to discuss potential upgrades and future planning? Your expertise would be instrumental in this.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best,
Morgan Redwood

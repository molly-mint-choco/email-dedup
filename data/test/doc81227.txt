Dear Samuel,

I trust this email finds you well. I'm forwarding you an update regarding the enhancement of our technical infrastructure. It's quite a brief read, but I believe it will provide you with a clearer understanding of our progress.

Looking forward to your thoughts on the matter.

Best,

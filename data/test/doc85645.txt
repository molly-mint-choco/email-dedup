Hi Jameson,

Just circling back on our previous conversation about the sales outlook. I took a dive into the pipeline data and it seems like we're in sync. Your team's doing a great job!

Let's set up a time to discuss potential strategies to optimize our forecast accuracy. How about sometime next week?

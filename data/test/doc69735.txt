Hi Sandra,

Just circling back on our conversation from last week regarding the updates to our compliance landscape. I've reviewed the recent changes and I think we're in a good position to adapt our operations accordingly.

I'll be pulling together a detailed briefing for the team to ensure everyone is on the same page. Let's set up a time in the coming week to review it together before we roll it out?

Look forward to hearing your thoughts.

Best,
Terrence Nguyen

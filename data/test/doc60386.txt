Hi Sandra,

I hope you're well. I've just gone through some feedback from our recent customer interactions and thought you might find them insightful. We've received quite a variety of responses, some of which could potentially influence our strategy moving forward.

Would you have some time this week to discuss? Let me know what works best for you.

Best,
Terrence Nguyen

Dear Linda,

I trust this message finds you well. I am writing to you today to discuss an important matter that is very close to my heart. As we navigate these challenging times, I strongly believe in the importance of fostering a positive and unified company culture. It is this shared belief and commitment that has made BigCorp what it is today – a dynamic, innovative, and forward-thinking organization.

As we look ahead, it is vital for us to ensure that our shared vision and values continue to be the driving force behind our actions. To this end, we have scheduled an all-hands meeting to discuss and reinforce the importance of our company culture. This meeting, which we are calling "Fostering a Unifying Atmosphere", is set to take place next week.

We believe that everyone in our organization, from top management to our newest hires, plays a crucial role in shaping our company culture. Thus, we are inviting all members of our team to this meeting, in the hopes that we can come together to discuss, reflect, and strategize on how best to maintain and strengthen our culture.

During this meeting, we will have the opportunity to discuss the different aspects of our culture that we value and wish to preserve, such as our commitment to innovation, our focus on teamwork, and our dedication to providing high-quality service to our clients. We will also discuss ways in which we can improve our culture and make it more inclusive, supportive and empowering.

I am aware that everyone's time is precious, and I want to assure you that we are doing our utmost to ensure that this meeting will be valuable and productive for all attendees. To help us prepare, we would appreciate any thoughts or suggestions that you might have on this important topic. Please feel free to share your ideas or concerns with either myself or Kevin Ward, who is also copied in this email.

Linda, your input, as always, will be invaluable. I look forward to hearing your thoughts and ideas, and to seeing you at the meeting next week.

Thank you for your time and your commitment to BigCorp. Together, we can continue to build a strong, dynamic, and inclusive company culture that will propel us forward.

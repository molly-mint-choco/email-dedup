Hey Sandra,

Hope this email finds you well. I'm sure you've been hearing the buzz around the office about the "next big thing" we've been working on behind the scenes. Well, I can confirm that the rumors are true. We're getting ready to launch a new product that we believe will truly revolutionize our industry.

I can't reveal too much just yet, but let's just say we're all pretty excited about it. Dennis and I thought you should be one of the first to know, considering how much your team will be involved in its rollout.

We'll be sharing more details soon, so keep an eye on your inbox. In the meantime, if you have any questions or would like to discuss further, don't hesitate to reach out.

Best,

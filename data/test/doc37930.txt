Hi Carter,

Just wanted to quickly update you regarding the operational adjustments we discussed in our last meeting. The team has been working diligently and we're seeing some positive results. We've managed to streamline several processes, increasing productivity by an estimated 15%. 

However, we've also identified a few areas that need further optimization. We're currently exploring potential solutions and will keep you updated on our progress.

As always, feel free to reach out if you have any questions or require additional information.

Best,
Natalia Ponce

Hi Tasha,

Thank you for taking time to review the customer feedback. Your initiative to discuss the insightful points in the next team meeting is commendable and certainly a good idea.

I'm available for a chat this week to further discuss this. Please let me know what time works best for you and I'll do my best to accommodate.

Thanks,
Glen

Hi Glen,

Hope you're doing well.

I've been reviewing the recent feedback we've received from our customers, and there are some insightful points that I believe could help us improve our products and services. I think it would be a good idea to discuss these in our next team meeting.

Let me know if you're available for a chat sometime this week to go over the main points before the meeting.

Best,
Tasha Burke

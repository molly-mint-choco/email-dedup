Dear Glen,

I trust this email finds you well. 

Following our previous discussion regarding the company's compliance measures, I have reviewed the updated guidelines as you advised. I must commend the comprehensiveness of these guidelines, they certainly uphold our high standards of integrity and transparency.

However, there are a few areas that I believe require further clarification. Specifically, the section regarding the handling of confidential information could use more explicit instructions. I believe this will enhance our adherence to both regulatory requirements and internal policies.

I appreciate your diligence and commitment in this matter. Let's arrange a meeting at your earliest convenience to discuss this further. 

Regards,
Tasha Burke

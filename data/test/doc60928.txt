----------------------------------------

Hi Glen,

Hope this email finds you in good spirits. I trust you had a chance to go through the preliminary financial plan that I forwarded to you last week. I thought it would be beneficial for us to have a more detailed discussion on the same, and so, decided to write to you about some of my thoughts.

As we navigate through the fiscal year, it's crucial for us to reevaluate our budgetary strategies. An element of this is understanding our financial goals and aligning them with our broader business objectives. I believe we are in a unique position this year to make significant strides, provided that we plan carefully and execute effectively.

In our last conversation, you mentioned a keen interest in investing in new technologies that could potentially enhance our operational efficiency. While I agree that being technologically progressive is crucial for our competitive edge, I think it's equally important to balance this with our budgetary considerations.

To this end, I've been working with the team here and have come up with a few ideas. For instance, we could consider implementing a phased approach, where we prioritize investments based on immediate necessity and potential ROI. This way, we can spread out our investments, reducing the immediate impact on our budget while still ensuring we stay ahead of the curve.

Additionally, we might want to consider exploring partnerships or collaborations that could help us acquire these technologies at a reduced cost. Morgan, who's been looped in to this email, has extensive experience in this domain and I'm sure could provide valuable insights.

I would love to discuss these ideas in more detail. Do let me know a suitable time for a meeting and we can deep dive into these aspects. I believe that with thoughtful planning and strategic execution, we can ensure a balanced budget while still achieving our financial and business objectives.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this.

Best,
Tasha Burke

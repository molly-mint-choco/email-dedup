Subject: Let's Discuss: Building Our Shared Values

----------------------------------------

Hi Deena,

I hope this email finds you well. I've been thinking a lot lately about the kind of environment we've created here at BigCorp. It's clear to me that our team is filled with talented, dedicated individuals who really care about the work we do.

However, I believe that we can always do more to foster a sense of community and shared values amongst our team. I've seen how a strong company culture can lead to increased productivity, employee satisfaction, and overall growth. It's important to me that everyone feels like they're part of something bigger, and that we're all working together towards a common goal.

To that end, I'd like to propose an all-hands meeting where we can discuss our company culture in more depth. I think it would be beneficial for everyone to have a say in what kind of culture we want to create, and how we can work together to achieve it.

I've cc'ed Ron on this email as well, as I know he has some valuable insights to share on this topic. If you're both available, let's try to schedule this meeting for sometime next week.

Thank you for considering my proposal. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this.

Best,
Jordan Gray
Sr. Fin. Analyst

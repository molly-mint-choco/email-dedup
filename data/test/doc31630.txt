Hi Adam,

Hope you're well. Following up on our discussion about the upcoming product rollout. 

I've been informed that the R&D team has finalized the product specs. We need to start syncing our support resources to ensure we are well-prepared for any customer queries post-launch. 

Could we set a meeting for later this week to discuss our strategy in more detail?

Best,
Fiona White

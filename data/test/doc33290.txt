Hi Ivan,

Thank you for your email. I am in agreement with you, we are in a good position for the product launch. 

As per my records, all major tasks have been completed. However, we are just finalising some minor details related to the marketing collateral, which we should be able to wrap up soon. I will coordinate with Nikhil to ensure that we have looked at all aspects.

Once completed, I'll provide an update.

Best regards,
Rosalie

Hi Rosalie,

I hope this email finds you well. I've been going over the details for the upcoming product launch and I think we're in a good position. I wanted to touch base and ensure we're on the same page before we proceed.

Could you please confirm if there are any outstanding tasks we need to address? I want to make sure we have all our bases covered. Nikhil, your input here would be invaluable as well. 

Looking forward to hearing from you both.

Best,
Ivan Mitchell

----------------------------------------

Hi Martin,

I hope this email finds you well. I've been thinking about our last conversation concerning our department's fiscal roadmap. You know, I think there's a lot of potential to streamline our operations and optimize our budget.

I was just going over some numbers, and I believe we can make some adjustments that could free up resources for other strategic initiatives. I'd love to catch up and discuss this further. How does your calendar look next week? 

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best,
Colleen Jenkins

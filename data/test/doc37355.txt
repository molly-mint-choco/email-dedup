Hi Sabrina,

Thank you for your email and for the updates on the recent strategic changes. I appreciate your proactive approach in seeking feedback from different departments.

I received the summary and will review it thoroughly. I will also consult with my team and compile our thoughts and concerns.

I am indeed available this week for a catch-up. Kindly suggest a suitable date and time, and I will do my best to accommodate it. 

Looking forward to our discussion.

Best,
Jameson

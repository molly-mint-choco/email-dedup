Hi Ruby,

Thanks for your previous email about our marketing strategy. I've taken a look at your suggestions and I think they're very insightful. Some adjustments to our marketing tactics could definitely help us reach our Q2 goals.

Let's schedule a meeting for next week to discuss this in more detail. Andreas, it would be great if you could share your input as well.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

Best,
Eileen Carter

Hi Mario,

I hope you're doing well. I've just had a meeting with Bianca regarding the recent changes in regulatory standards. We thought it would be beneficial to arrange a brief catch-up with you as well. This will be a good opportunity to ensure that our strategies align with the updates and that we're on the same page.

Let me know what time works best for you. Looking forward to our discussion.

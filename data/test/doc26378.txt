Dear Sabrina,

I trust this message finds you well. I've been going over the updated marketing strategy you sent over and I must say, it's quite comprehensive. I appreciate your in-depth approach to market penetration.

However, there are a few areas that need some fine-tuning. Specifically, the demographic targeting could be more focused, and I think we might benefit from exploring some alternative channels of engagement.

Let's arrange a meeting early next week to discuss these points further. I believe with a few tweaks, this strategy could truly drive us forward in the market.

Best regards,
Morgan Redwood

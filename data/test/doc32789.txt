Dear Thomas,

I trust this email finds you well.

As we approach the final stages of our upcoming product's release, I believe it's imperative that we align all our resources and strategies to ensure a successful and impactful launch.

I want to take this opportunity to reiterate the importance of your team's role in this crucial phase. The financial implications of this launch are significant, and thus, we need to ensure that all our costings and budget allocations are in order. Kindly confirm that all financial aspects related to this release, including marketing expenses, production costs, and other associated expenses have been adequately accounted for.

I would appreciate it if you could provide an update on the current status of these matters by the end of this week. It would be beneficial to have a meeting to discuss any potential issues or concerns that may impact our financial strategy for the launch.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. Let's ensure we're fully prepared for this exciting step forward for our company.

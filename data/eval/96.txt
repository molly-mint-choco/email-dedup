----------------------------------------

Dear Carter,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm writing to discuss a topic of significant importance to our company's growth and sustainability - our employee development strategies. 

In light of the recent changes in our business landscape, it's imperative that we reassess and enhance our current practices. I believe that our HR and talent management team is instrumental in driving this change. 

In the coming weeks, I suggest we conduct a comprehensive review of our talent management strategies. This would involve evaluating our current procedures, identifying areas of improvement, and implementing necessary changes in a timely and efficient manner. 

I look forward to your valuable insights and contributions to this initiative. Please feel free to share any preliminary thoughts or suggestions you might have at your earliest convenience.

We are also looping in Felicia Lee in this conversation to benefit from her vast experience and expertise in this area.

Thank you for your time and commitment to enhancing our company's talent management strategies.

Best,
Natalia Ponce

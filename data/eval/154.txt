Dear Tyler,

I hope this email finds you well. Following up on our recent conversation regarding the new regulatory guidelines, I have taken the initiative, with the help of Olivia, to review some of the points you raised.

As per the discussion, it appears there is a need for us to conduct an in-depth examination of the recent legal updates and their implications on our operations. I believe this will help us ensure we remain compliant and continue to promote a culture of integrity within our organization.

I propose we schedule a follow-up meeting next week to delve into the nuances of these guidelines. Olivia has kindly agreed to provide us with a comprehensive legal perspective on the matter.

Please let me know what times work best for you so we can proceed accordingly. 

Best regards,
Kiara Dou

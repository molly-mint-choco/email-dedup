Hi Louise,

Just wanted to quickly touch base on the recent operational enhancements. I've been noticing some really positive changes; the new system seems to be integrating well with our current workflow.

I'm curious about your thoughts on the recent updates. Are there any areas you think could use further improvement, or are there any issues we need to address?

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

Best,

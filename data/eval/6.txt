Hi Rosalie,

Trust this email finds you well. I'm just reaching out because I wanted to have a chat about our financial strategies for the second quarter. I think there are a few areas where we could tighten up our budget allocations and potentially make some significant savings.

Mind if we schedule a quick meeting next week to discuss this? Let's also include Nikhil in our discussion, I believe his input would be valuable.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best,
Ivan Mitchell

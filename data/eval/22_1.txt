Hi Harriet,

Thank you for your feedback. I am glad to hear the recent operational enhancements have been positive.

From my perspective, the integration has been smooth and the new system has definitely improved our workflow efficiency. However, there are a couple of minor areas we may need to address. I have noticed slight delays in reporting due to server load during peak times. Additionally, some team members have mentioned occasional difficulties with the user interface.

I am compiling a detailed report on these issues for our next meeting, and have been gathering suggestions for possible solutions.

I appreciate your support as we continue to fine-tune the system for optimal performance.

Best,
Louise

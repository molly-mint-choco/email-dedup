Subject: Refining our Promotional Approach

Hi Linda,

I hope this email finds you well. I've been thinking about our upcoming marketing campaign and I believe it's crucial that we reassess our current strategy.

Our core objective should always be to engage our target audience and maximize our reach. To do so, I propose a more data-driven approach. By leveraging customer analytics and behavior patterns, we can create personalized marketing content that resonates with our audience. 

In addition, I think it would be beneficial to explore some innovative platforms for ad placement. By diversifying our reach, we may be able to tap into new customer segments.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. If you have any suggestions or if there's any part of the strategy you'd like to discuss further, please let me know. 

Looking forward to your feedback.

Best,
Wayne Johnson
